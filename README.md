1. Title
Image-Based Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning (ResNet-50)

2. Introduction / Background
Improper waste segregation is a major challenge in recycling systems and environmental sustainability. Manual sorting of garbage is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. With the increasing availability of image data and advances in deep learning, automated garbage classification systems can help improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
This project proposes an image-based garbage classification system using a convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) to classify waste into predefined categories such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic waste.

3. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop an automated system that accurately classifies images of garbage into multiple categories using deep learning techniques. The system should handle real-world challenges such as varying lighting conditions, backgrounds, and object shapes.

4. Objectives
•	To build an image classification model for garbage sorting
•	To use transfer learning with ResNet-50 for improved performance
•	To evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
•	To analyze misclassifications and improve model robustness
